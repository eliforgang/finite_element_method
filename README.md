# finite_element_method

These Python files were written for a finite element methods class. Files that aren't included because I wasn't the only collaborator include programs to solve for the 1D Galerkin method, set up matrices and vectors for the 2D Galerkin method, solve for the 2D Galerkin method, and approximating the smallest eigenvalue of a matrix using the Rayleigh quotient.
