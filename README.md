# Finite_Element_Method

These Python files were written for a finite element methods class. Files that aren't included because I wasn't the only contributor include: 
- Solving for the 1D Galerkin method, 
- Setting up matrices and vectors for the 2D Galerkin method,
- Solving for the 2D Galerkin method, and
- Approximating the smallest eigenvalue of a matrix using the Rayleigh quotient.
